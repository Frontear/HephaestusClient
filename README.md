# HephaestusClient
A special modded minecraft client made in forge. This client contains the basis for a hacked client, and can be expanded upon to build your own HephaestusClient

## Building
We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Eclipse will require additional steps to set up, which we won't cover here.

- Import build.gradle
- Run the HephaestusClient

If no configurations are detected, `gradlew genIntelliJRuns` will solve that.

## Contributing
This project is not meant to be contributed upon. It's meant to act as a base for anyone who'd like to make their own client. The only contributions that will be accepted are bug fixes or updates for different minecraft versions.
